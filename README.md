This project uses the following technologies:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for mobile frontend iOs & Android
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the package manager
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for maintaining consistency throughout the code base
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) With an all-new design that looks great on macOS Big Sur, Xcode 12 has customizable font sizes for the navigator, streamlined code completion, and new document tabs. Xcode 12 builds Universal apps by default to support Mac with Apple Silicon, often without changing a single line of code.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjw07qDBhBxEiwA6pPbHpRPUCuKe-jtdsdpeUtfBDBLBXdoFiF-EcwrFwJwc2QE0NQ4dG6IjhoCboUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.
